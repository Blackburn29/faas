# FaaS

The purpose of the FaaS (Factoring as a Service) project is to create a tool that allows anyone to factor a 512-bit key with minimal time and cost. To do this, we have developed a framework for launching an compute cluster on Amazon EC2 and running a parallelized number field sieve implementation to factor keys.
